                <p>My name is Mark Cygnarowicz and I was born and raised in Pittsburgh PA. I enlisted in the United States Navy and went to boot camp in Great Lakes Chicago in January of 2003. I was in the navy for 17.25 years before I decided to make a life change. I got out of the navy and began work for Rite Solutions in Middletown RI. My job at Rite Solutions as a technical write is to develop and maintain the procedures for handling weapons on submarines in their Torpedo Rooms primarily. In July of 2021 I signed up for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp course and I have been getting my ass kicked since day one. However, as Dory would say, "Just keep swimming"</p>
